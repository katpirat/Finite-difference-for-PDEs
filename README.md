# Finite-difference-for-PDEs
Explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson for the heat equation and the Black-Scholes pricing equation.

This small project solves PDE's using finite difference schemes, both the explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson method. 
In one of the projects a specific PDE, given as y(t, x) = exp(-\pi^(2) * t) * sin( \pi * x). 
In the second script, the Black-Scholes PDE is solved, and put and call options are priced. 

Modify all you want.
